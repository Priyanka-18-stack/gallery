## Project Overview

The assignment focuses on replicating a UI design from Figma with high accuracy. Key requirements include:

- **Responsive layout for laptop screens** (width ≥ 768px)  
- **Left half of the screen remains empty**  
- **Right half contains two main widgets**:  
  1. **Tabs Widget** – has three tabs: "About Me", "Experiences", and "Recommended". Tabs are clickable and display corresponding content.  
  2. **Gallery Widget** – allows adding more photos via the "Add Image" button.
